            About AgroVest
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">
            Welcome to AgroVest, where innovation meets agriculture. We're
            redefining how farmers connect with investors and customers through
            our cutting-edge platform. AgroVest empowers farmers to tokenize
            their businesses, opening up new avenues for investment and growth.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">
            Our platform provides a secure, decentralized environment for
            farmers to showcase their products and attract investment from a
            global network of investors. By digitizing agricultural assets and
            offering them on a dynamic marketplace, we bridge the gap between
            farm operations and capital, fostering sustainable growth and
            increased profitability.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-900">
            Join us in shaping the future of farming with transparency,
            efficiency, and innovation.
